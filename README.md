This is a simple cookie consent project built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**How to run the project:**

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click `index.html` or open it in any modern web browser.
4. The cookie consent banner will appear on first load and remember your choice.
